'''
Put the names of all the folders you want to ignore while making your directory' tree in the `ignor` list.

Note: Do not try to change the dimension or the name of the list. Use "/<folder-name>" convention for writing your folders. For example:

ignor = [
    "/.git",
    "/__pycache__"
]

Also remember to give '/' in path rather than '\'.
